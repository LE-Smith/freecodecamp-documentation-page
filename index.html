        <p>
          The physical universe is defined as all of space and time[a]
          (collectively referred to as spacetime) and their contents.[10] Such
          contents comprise all of energy in its various forms, including
          electromagnetic radiation and matter, and therefore planets, moons,
          stars, galaxies, and the contents of intergalactic space.[23][24][25]
          The universe also includes the physical laws that influence energy and
          matter, such as conservation laws, classical mechanics, and
          relativity.[26]
        </p>
        <p>
          The universe is often defined as "the totality of existence", or
          everything that exists, everything that has existed, and everything
          that will exist.[26] In fact, some philosophers and scientists support
          the inclusion of ideas and abstract concepts—such as mathematics and
          logic—in the definition of the universe.[28][29][30] The word universe
          may also refer to concepts such as the cosmos, the world, and
          nature.[31][32]

          <h2>Etymology</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The word universe derives from the Old French word univers, which in
          turn derives from the Latin word universum.[33] The Latin word was
          used by Cicero and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as
          the modern English word is used.[34]
        </p>
        <p>
          A term for "universe" among the ancient Greek philosophers from
          Pythagoras onwards was τὸ πᾶν, tò pân ("the all"), defined as all
          matter and all space, and τὸ ὅλον, tò hólon ("all things"), which did
          not necessarily include the void.[35][36] Another synonym was ὁ
          κόσμος, ho kósmos (meaning the world, the cosmos).[37] Synonyms are
          also found in Latin authors (totum, mundus, natura)[38] and survive in
          modern languages, e.g., the German words Das All, Weltall, and Natur
          for universe. The same synonyms are found in English, such as
          everything (as in the theory of everything), the cosmos (as in
          cosmology), the world (as in the many-worlds interpretation), and
          nature (as in natural laws or natural philosophy).[39]

            The prevailing model for the evolution of the universe is the Big
            Bang theory.[40][41] The Big Bang model states that the earliest
            state of the universe was an extremely hot and dense one, and that
            the universe subsequently expanded and cooled. The model is based on
            general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as
            homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a
            cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the
            Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably
            good account of various observations about the universe. The Big
            Bang model accounts for observations such as the correlation of
            distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of
            hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.
          </p>
          <p>
            The initial hot, dense state is called the Planck epoch, a brief
            period extending from time zero to one Planck time unit of
            approximately 10−43 seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of
            matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state,
            and gravity—currently the weakest by far of the four known forces—is
            believed to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and
            all the forces may have been unified. Since the Planck epoch, space
            has been expanding to its present scale, with a very short but
            intense period of cosmic inflation believed to have occurred within
            the first 10−32 seconds.[42] This was a kind of expansion different
            from those we can see around us today. Objects in space did not
            physically move; instead the metric that defines space itself
            changed. Although objects in spacetime cannot move faster than the
            speed of light, this limitation does not apply to the metric
            governing spacetime itself. This initial period of inflation is
            believed to explain why space appears to be very flat, and much
            larger than light could travel since the start of the
            universe.[clarification needed]

            Within the first fraction of a second of the universe's existence,
            the four fundamental forces had separated. As the universe continued
            to cool down from its inconceivably hot state, various types of
            subatomic particles were able to form in short periods of time known
            as the quark epoch, the hadron epoch, and the lepton epoch.
            Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time
            following the Big Bang. These elementary particles associated stably
            into ever larger combinations, including stable protons and
            neutrons, which then formed more complex atomic nuclei through
            nuclear fusion. This process, known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis,
            only lasted for about 17 minutes and ended about 20 minutes after
            the Big Bang, so only the fastest and simplest reactions occurred.
            About 25% of the protons and all the neutrons in the universe, by
            mass, were converted to helium, with small amounts of deuterium (a
            form of hydrogen) and traces of lithium. Any other element was only
            formed in very tiny quantities. The other 75% of the protons
            remained unaffected, as hydrogen nuclei.

            Of the four fundamental interactions, gravitation is the dominant at
            astronomical length scales. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by
            contrast, the effects of positive and negative charges tend to
            cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant
            on astronomical length scales. The remaining two interactions, the
            weak and strong nuclear forces, decline very rapidly with distance;
            their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.

          <p>
            The universe appears to have much more matter than antimatter, an
            asymmetry possibly related to the CP violation.[45] This imbalance
            between matter and antimatter is partially responsible for the
            existence of all matter existing today, since matter and antimatter,
            if equally produced at the Big Bang, would have completely
            annihilated each other and left only photons as a result of their
            interaction.[46][47] The universe also appears to have neither net
            momentum nor angular momentum, which follows accepted physical laws
            if the universe is finite. These laws are Gauss's law and the
            non-divergence of the stress-energy-momentum pseudotensor.[48]

          <h2>Composition</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The universe is composed almost completely of dark energy, dark
          matter, and ordinary matter. Other contents are electromagnetic
          radiation (estimated to constitute from 0.005% to close to 0.01% of
          the total mass-energy of the universe) and antimatter.[81][82][83] The
          proportions of all types of matter and energy have changed over the
          history of the universe.[84] The total amount of electromagnetic
          radiation generated within the universe has decreased by 1/2 in the
          past 2 billion years.[85][86] Today, ordinary matter, which includes
          atoms, stars, galaxies, and life, accounts for only 4.9% of the
          contents of the Universe.[8] The present overall density of this type
          of matter is very low, roughly 4.5 × 10−31 grams per cubic centimetre,
          corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every
          four cubic metres of volume.[6] The nature of both dark energy and
          dark matter is unknown. Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that
          has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the cosmic
          contents. Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is
          causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate, accounts for the
          remaining 68.3% of the contents.[8][87][88]
        </p>
        <p>
          Matter, dark matter, and dark energy are distributed homogeneously
          throughout the universe over length scales longer than 300 million
          light-years or so.[89] However, over shorter length-scales, matter
          tends to clump hierarchically; many atoms are condensed into stars,
          most stars into galaxies, most galaxies into clusters, superclusters
          and, finally, large-scale galactic filaments. The observable universe
          contains more than 2 trillion (1012) galaxies[90] and, overall, as
          many as an estimated 1×1024 stars[91][92] (more stars than all the
          grains of sand on planet Earth).[93] Typical galaxies range from
          dwarfs with as few as ten million[94] (107) stars up to giants with
          one trillion[95] (1012) stars. Between the larger structures are
          voids, which are typically 10–150 Mpc (33 million–490 million ly) in
          diameter. The Milky Way is in the Local Group of galaxies, which in
          turn is in the Laniakea Supercluster.[96] This supercluster spans over
          500 million light-years, while the Local Group spans over 10 million
          light-years.[97] The Universe also has vast regions of relative
          emptiness; the largest known void measures 1.8 billion ly (550 Mpc)
          across.[98]
        </p>
        <p>
          The observable universe is isotropic on scales significantly larger
          than superclusters, meaning that the statistical properties of the
          universe are the same in all directions as observed from Earth. The
          universe is bathed in highly isotropic microwave radiation that
          corresponds to a thermal equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly
          2.72548 kelvins.[7] The hypothesis that the large-scale universe is
          homogeneous and isotropic is known as the cosmological principle.[100]
          A universe that is both homogeneous and isotropic looks the same from
          all vantage points[101] and has no center.[102]
